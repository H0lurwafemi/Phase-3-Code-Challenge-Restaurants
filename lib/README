Restaurant Review System with SQLAlchemy
This project is a simple restaurant review system implemented using SQLAlchemy, a popular Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It features three main models: Restaurant, Customer, and Review, and allows users to interact with these models to manage restaurant reviews.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:

Python installed on your machine.

SQLAlchemy library installed. You can install it using pip:
A SQLite database named restaurants.db (the database file name can be configured in the code) in the same directory as the project files.

Running the Application
To interact with the restaurant review system, you can use a Python script and create instances of Restaurant, Customer, and Review as needed. The main code for the models and relationships is provided in the Python script.

Models
Restaurant
Represents a restaurant with attributes like name and price.
Stores reviews left by customers.
Has a many-to-many relationship with Customer.
Customer
Represents a customer with first_name and last_name.
Can leave reviews for restaurants.
Has a many-to-many relationship with Restaurant.
Review
Represents a review left by a customer for a restaurant.
Contains a star rating.
Belongs to both a Restaurant and a Customer.
Methods and Features
The project includes several methods and features:

Object Relationship Methods for accessing relationships between models.
Aggregate and Relationship Methods for advanced functionality.
For example, you can find the fanciest restaurant, the favorite restaurant for a customer, add and delete reviews, and more.

Acknowledgments
This project is a simple example of using SQLAlchemy to create a restaurant review system. It can be expanded and customized to fit more complex use cases.
